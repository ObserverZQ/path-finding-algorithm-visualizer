Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an uninformed search algorithm that explores the state space in layers. Starting from the initial state, BFS expands all neighboring states before moving on to states at the next depth level. It uses a queue (FIFO) to manage the frontier, ensuring that the shallowest unexplored node is always selected next.

In CS50’s Introduction to AI with Python, BFS is commonly introduced as the simplest algorithm that guarantees correctness. When all actions have equal cost, BFS is both complete and optimal. The first time the goal is reached, the path found is guaranteed to be the shortest in terms of number of steps. This makes BFS well suited for unweighted graphs, puzzles, and grid-based environments without variable movement costs.

The major limitation of BFS is its memory usage. Because it stores all nodes at the current depth level, the frontier can grow exponentially as the branching factor increases. Even when the solution is relatively shallow, BFS may consume a large amount of memory, making it impractical for large or complex search spaces.

BFS is most effective when:

The search space is small or moderately sized

Optimality is required

All step costs are uniform

As a baseline algorithm, BFS provides a clear reference point for understanding more advanced search strategies.
