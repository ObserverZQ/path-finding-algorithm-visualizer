# Path-Finding Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a web-based interactive visualizer for classic path-finding algorithms, built to support intuitive exploration of search strategies and performance trade-offs.

It allows users to:
- Explore algorithms including breadth-first search, depth-first search, greedy best-first search, and A* search.
- Edit grids and obstacles interactively
- Observe step-by-step execution of algorithms(WIP)
- Adjust playback speed to compare different search behaviors

The project was inspired by coursework on search algorithms and aims to bridge algorithmic concepts with human-centered visualization.

Tech Stack: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
